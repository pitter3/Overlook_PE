## Contributors:
This was a solo project! 

## Context:
This is the final solo project of Mod 2 at Turing School of Software & Design. We were given 1 week to create this project from scratch using a provided comp found. I probably spent 50-60 hours on this project over the week. The comp for the project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html).

## Learning Goals:
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a clear and accessible user interface
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
